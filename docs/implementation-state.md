# Implementation state
Current phase: 0
Current slice: B — Maven project, FileMetrics record, PackageSummary grouping, one JUnit test. Implemented; awaiting developer verification and learning-gate answers.
Last working commit: none (repository initialized 2026-09-23, nothing committed yet)

## Implemented and personally verified
- Slice A (2026-09-23): spec pack moved to `docs/spec/`, links fixed, git initialized on `main`, ignore policy, README. Verified by Claude; developer verification pending.
- Slice B (2026-09-23), implemented and tests pass, developer verification pending:
  - `backend/pom.xml`: Java 21 via `maven.compiler.release`, JUnit Jupiter 6.0.3 (test scope), compiler plugin 3.15.0, Surefire 3.5.6. Versions match those managed by Spring Boot 4.1.1 (checked on Maven Central).
  - Maven Wrapper 3.3.4 generated with `mvn wrapper:wrapper` (only-script mode: `mvnw`, `mvnw.cmd`, `.mvn/wrapper/maven-wrapper.properties`, no jar).
  - `dev.codepulse.engine.FileMetrics` record (`relativePath`, `packageName`, `physicalLoc`, `methodCount`) with compact-constructor validation.
  - `dev.codepulse.engine.PackageSummary`: defensive `List.copyOf`, duplicate-path rejection, `groupByPackage()` → `TreeMap<String, TreeSet<String>>`, `render()` sorted text with plain loops.
  - `dev.codepulse.Phase0Main`: runnable sample (to be deleted in Phase 4).
  - `PackageSummaryTest`: sorted grouping, empty input, duplicate path rejection.

## Commands and observed results
- 2026-09-23 `java -version` → OpenJDK 21.0.11 (Homebrew). `mvn -version` → Apache Maven 3.9.16. Toolchain ready for Phase 0.
- 2026-09-23 `git init -b main` → empty repository created; no commits.
- 2026-09-23 `cd backend && mvn -q -B wrapper:wrapper` → exit 0, wrapper 3.3.4 files created.
- 2026-09-23 `./mvnw -B test` (first run) → BUILD FAILURE after 2m49s: `Could not transfer artifact org.apache.maven.surefire:surefire-providers:pom:3.5.6 ... Can't assign requested address`. Compilation of 3 main + 1 test class had succeeded. Hypothesis: transient socket/network error, not POM. Evidence: `curl` of the artifact URL returned HTTP 200.
- 2026-09-23 `./mvnw -B test` (retry, no changes) → BUILD SUCCESS. `Tests run: 3, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0` in `PackageSummaryTest`.
- 2026-09-23 `java -cp target/classes dev.codepulse.Phase0Main` → printed 3 package blocks sorted: `(default package)`, `dev.codepulse`, `dev.codepulse.engine`, files sorted within each. Exit 0.

## Known failures or limitations
- No application code exists. Nothing in this repository runs yet.
- Deferred by design until their phase: Spring Boot (4), PostgreSQL/JPA/Flyway (5), sessions/CSRF (6), GitHub acquisition (7), worker (8), React (9), Docker/CI (10).

## Concepts I can explain without assistance
- (developer fills this in; the learning gate is what the developer can explain, not what Claude generated)
- Candidates from Slice B: JDK vs JVM vs bytecode; Maven lifecycle phases (compile → test-compile → test); what a record generates; `List<FileMetrics>` and `Map<String, Set<String>>`; why `TreeMap`/`TreeSet` give deterministic output; defensive copy with `List.copyOf`; `Set.add` returning false.

## Decisions and deviations from the specification
- 2026-09-23 Spec files were MOVED (not copied) into `docs/spec/` so there is a single source of truth. Reason: root copies would drift. Alternative: keep copies at root (rejected). Evidence: `START-HERE.md`, `Claude-Build-Playbook.md`, and the Blueprint's link to the playbook were updated so relative links still resolve. No specification content was changed.
- 2026-09-23 Phase 0 code will live in `backend/` as a plain Java 21 Maven module (no Spring) under package `dev.codepulse.engine`. Reason: Phases 1–3 build the engine in the same module and Phase 4 adds Spring around it, so nothing is discarded. Alternative: disposable `learning/phase0/` module (rejected: repeats Maven setup in Phase 1).
- 2026-09-23 Phase 0 `FileMetrics` will use a subset of the `java-metrics-v1` field names from Blueprint 9.3 (`relativePath`, `packageName`, `physicalLoc`, `methodCount`) so Phase 2 extends the record instead of renaming it. Phase 0 values are hand-constructed learning data, not parsed source.
- 2026-09-23 ADR files in `docs/decisions/` are written when a decision is implemented (starting Phase 4). Blueprint section 23 already records the core decisions and their rationale.
- 2026-09-23 `docs/architecture/`, `docs/decisions/`, `docs/metrics/`, `docs/learning/` are created when a phase first needs them, not up front.

## Next smallest slice
- Slice C (after B is verified): deliberate exception traced in the IDE debugger (the duplicate-path `IllegalArgumentException` is the candidate: set a breakpoint in `PackageSummary.rejectDuplicatePaths` and inspect `seen`), a `HashSet` mutated-key equality example showing why mutable keys break `contains`, then the Phase 0 checkpoint (learning gate: run the build, explain source→bytecode→execution, explain why mutating a set key is dangerous).
- Phase 0 exit also requires: developer answers the three understanding questions and the prediction, and can explain class vs object vs interface vs record.
